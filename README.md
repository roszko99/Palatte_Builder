# Palatte_Builder
# Created by Owen Roszkowski (owenr@rosz.net) in February, 2018.

This is my first git for my small project Palatte_Builder. It is program that generates color pallattes of different kinds in the window. It is my first attempt at writing a graphical program in C++, and I used the SFML library to do so.

Left click to change the palatte, right click to change what kind of pallatte is generated
